The properties located at 3660 and 3690 152 Street, formerly known as the Rosemary Heights Retreat Centre, have recently changed ownership. The previous owner, Peterson, has sold the land to Polygon — the developers behind Harvard Gardens.

The Rosemary Heights Community Association (RHCA) has met with Polygon on two occasions to learn more about their development intentions and to share community feedback. During these meetings, RHCA representatives raised serious concerns regarding environmental impact, overcrowded schools, traffic congestion, parking, surrounding infrastructure, and compliance with the existing Neighborhood Concept Plan (NCP).

## Polygon's Development Plans

Despite this input, Polygon has indicated that it will proceed with a high-density development that disregards all of the community's concerns. Current plans include the construction of approximately **200 three story townhomes and 175 condominium units** across two apartment buildings (4 and 6 stories in height).

This proposal represents a significant departure from the intent of the NCP, which designates this land for institutional and park use. The scale and density of the project threaten to place undue pressure on local infrastructure and alter the character of our neighborhood in ways that many residents find deeply troubling.

## Community Impact Concerns

This development will lead to increased overcrowding in local schools and create traffic chaos on surrounding residential streets. With access points planned on the newly twinned 152 Street "highway," the risk of serious traffic incidents is a growing concern. As we all know, high-density developments typically offer little to no street parking, which inevitably spills over onto the surrounding neighborhood. 

The project also threatens to decimate a biodiverse, ecologically sensitive area, disrupt animal habitats — highlighted by Surrey as a wildlife hub and corridor — and significantly reduce residents' quality of life due to prolonged construction noise expected to last several years.

Perhaps most troubling is that this development does not address the housing crisis, as the units are expected to be priced well beyond what is affordable for those most in need. This appears to be yet another case of developer-driven expansion at the expense of community well-being and environmental sustainability.

## RHCA Response and Next Steps

The RHCA plans to re-engage with city staff and council to advocate for keeping this property within the bounds of the NCP and ensuring it is used as originally intended. In the next few weeks Polygon will mail out flyers seeking feedback from residents within 100 meters of the property.

We will soon be calling on you, the community! We need to send a coordinated response to Polygon, city staff, council, newspapers, that unrestrained development has no place in our wonderful neighborhood. We'll have more on this in the coming weeks.

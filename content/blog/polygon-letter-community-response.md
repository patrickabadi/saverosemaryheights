Dear Rosemary Heights Community,

We are writing to clarify for our community a recent communication from Polygon Homes, which was sent only to households in close proximity to the former Rosemary Heights Retreat Centre, outlining updates to their proposed development plans.

## Polygon's Letter to Neighbours

On August 14, 2025, Polygon sent the following letter to nearby residents:

---

**Neighbours of Rosemary Heights**
**Surrey, BC**
**August 14, 2025**

**Dear Neighbour,**

**Re: Update on Polygon's Proposed Development for 3660 and 3690 152nd Street**

We are writing to thank you for your feedback on our proposed development at 3660 and 3690 152nd Street. Your input over the last few months has been valuable in helping us to understand and address concerns from the community, while also providing much-needed housing. We are, therefore, writing to share the new project proposal with the following revisions:

### Reduced Density

• Two apartment buildings with 175 units are removed.
• The 90-space childcare facility is removed.
• Replaced by 32 townhome units, for a revised total of 233 units, down from the original proposal of 375 units, a 38% decrease in residential density.
• This will reduce the impact on local schools, parking, traffic and the environment.

### Traffic Safety

• Site entry and exit is moved north along 152nd allowing for more distance from 36th Ave.
• A protected-T intersection will allow for safe left-hand turns into and out of the site.
• Deletion of the daycare and reduced housing unit density will significantly reduce traffic to and from the site.

### Environmental Protection, Sustainability and Greater Community Benefit

• We will continue to
  ◦ dedicate approximately 40% of the overall site as protected riparian land.
  ◦ cluster the built-footprint, so as to preserve multiple mature tree stands.
  ◦ extend the Nicomekl Waterfront Trail using low-impact construction.
  ◦ create a new publicly-accessible trail system throughout the development to connect the greater community to the new Nicomekl Waterfront Trail extension.

### Official Community Plan Compliant

• The project is fully compliant with the Official Community Plan.

Thank you for taking the time to review the changes to our proposed development for Rosemary Heights. If you have any questions about the revisions, please feel welcome to contact us anytime at your convenience by emailing Alison Keller at akeller@polyhomes.com.

## RHCA's Response: Why We Remain Opposed

While Polygon has presented their changes as significant, the Rosemary Heights Community Association (RHCA) remains resolute in our opposition to this project for the following reasons:

### 1. Misrepresentation of OCP Compliance

Polygon claims their proposal is "fully compliant" with the Official Community Plan (OCP). This is misleading. The OCP and, more importantly, the Neighbourhood Concept Plan (NCP) designate these properties as Institutional/Parkland. The OCP only notes that the land could be considered for residential use in the future, but this requires a zoning change, which cannot move forward without both Council approval and meaningful community support. At present, the land use is clear, it is zoned for institutional use, non-residential only (such as a church, firehall, school, recreation center or public library) and it is not zoned for the kind of residential development Polygon is proposing. It is also important to note that when the property and surrounding neighbourhood was planned, it was anticipated that a right-in/right-out entrance off of 152nd Northbound was all that was needed, since the property is zoned as institutional and was never planned to accommodate hundreds of residents. As is clear from the hundreds of responses the City has received, the community does not support the developer's proposal to change the zoning on this property.

**As a side note:** A few years ago, under Mayor Doug McCallum, the City of Surrey offered to purchase the land at a value consistent with its current zoning designation. The developer refused this offer, based on their speculation that the property might one day be rezoned for residential use. The owners of the Rosemary Heights Retreat Centre lands have made a misguided investment decision by over-confidently assuming they could obtain the rezoning against the wishes of the community, and our neighbourhood should not be forced to pay the price of their mistake.

### 2. Density, Traffic, Parking, and Infrastructure

The changes Polygon outlines removing an apartment building and a childcare facility, and replacing them with townhomes are minor adjustments that do not address the core issues we have repeatedly raised:

• **Traffic & Safety:** The proposed "protected-T intersection" along 152nd is not only insufficient but dangerous. As residents, we know the speeds vehicles reach while coming downhill from the bluff. Introducing a left-turn intersection here will only increase the risk of collisions.

• **Parking & Infrastructure:** Even with reduced density, the proposed 233 units will strain parking availability and local infrastructure. These concerns remain unaddressed.

• **Schools & Healthcare:** As is well-known, our neighbourhood's schools and our community healthcare system are over-capacity and bursting at the seams.

### 3. Environmental Concerns & Greenspace

These lands are some of the last remaining streamside protected forest in the City of Surrey. Polygon highlights that 40% of the land will be 'protected,' but this area is riparian forest that is already undevelopable. In reality, they are not protecting anything of value to their development plans. Through a Freedom of Information (FOI) request, RHCA has confirmed that City staff themselves suggested development should occur only on already disturbed portions of the property, leaving the remaining forested greenspace intact. Polygon has chosen to ignore this professional guidance with their proposal. We will be sending details on the information obtained via the FOI request in a future email.

### 4. Community Position

The RHCA has been consistent and transparent: we support responsible development. There have been numerous development permits within our neighbourhood recently that are consistent with the character of our existing community and with the NCP. However, this proposal, even with revisions, does not meet that standard. The property should remain zoned as it is today: Institutional/Parkland. The community has been clear that traffic, density, safety, and environmental preservation are top priorities, and Polygon's revised plan does not meaningfully address these issues.

## Your Voice Continues to Matter

We encourage all residents to remain engaged and to continue voicing their concerns to City Council. This decision will not move forward without the support of both the community and Council, and your voices are essential in ensuring that Rosemary Heights develops responsibly, with safety, sustainability, and livability at the forefront.

## Contact Information

If you wish to communicate your thoughts on the latest proposal, the following contact list can be copy/pasted into the BCC field of your email. The RHCA recommends that you include a request for a formal response to your message when emailing any elected officials.

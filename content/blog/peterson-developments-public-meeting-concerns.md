The Rosemary Heights Community Association (RHCA) attended the Peterson public information session held on May 24th. Many members of our community also attended and were disheartened by the developers' proposed plan. Peterson intends to construct on the properties located at 3660 & 3690 152 St, aiming for the highest possible density without considering the impact on the surrounding community.

Despite raising valid concerns about the environment, infrastructure, parking, neighborhood concept plan (NCP), and traffic, our worries were disregarded or brushed aside as non-issues. The developers presented future promises of schools, roads, and hospitals being built just in time for this development, conveniently overlooking the fact that these long-standing infrastructure issues have persisted for the past decade.

## Call for Development Moratorium

Therefore, the RHCA urgently calls upon the city council to impose a moratorium on development in the Rosemary Heights & Morgan Creek area, specifically regarding the properties at 3660 & 3690 152 St, until the legitimate concerns about infrastructure are adequately addressed. Additionally, we extend an invitation to Peterson to engage in a meaningful discussion with our group, allowing us to express our concerns and seek mutual understanding.

Either Peterson is woefully unaware of the challenges associated with this property or they are solely focused on maximizing profits, with little regard for the potential consequences.

## 2018 RHCA Report Still Relevant

In 2018, the RHCA compiled a comprehensive report highlighting our concerns regarding this property, which remains relevant today, if not more prominent. You can access the report here: [Final Report to Council (PDF)](/Final-Report-to-Council.pdf)

The RHCA has consistently advocated for responsible development. Unfortunately, the proposal put forth by Peterson deviates so drastically from our community's expectations that we are compelled to take action. We have already initiated communication with the city, and soon we will urge our RHCA members to provide their feedback in form of emails or letters.

Dear Rosemary Heights Residents,

We wanted to share some **encouraging news** â€” your voices are making a difference! The community feedback on Polygon's high-density development proposal is not only being noticed, but it's also working.

## Community Response is Having Real Impact

Over the past few days, we've seen an outpouring of thoughtful, passionate emails from neighbors who care deeply about preserving the character of Rosemary Heights. These messages are having a real impact.

We've spoken directly with several city councilors, and the response has been clear: **they agree this proposal should not go forward.** But here's the key â€” they've also emphasized that strong, ongoing community engagement is what gives them the power to push back.

## The Power is in Our Unity

Simply put: **if the people of Rosemary Heights overwhelmingly oppose this rezoning and development, it will not pass.**

So let's keep the pressure on. If you haven't written in yet, now's the time. Even if you simply copy and paste our template email and submit it, it still counts as a powerful vote of opposition to this project. Every message shows the city just how united our community is.

## Take Action Now

Here's a link to our previous call-to-action with the template email included:
